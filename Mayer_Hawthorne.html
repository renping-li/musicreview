  <h1>Mayer Hawthorne</h1>  
  <b>A Strange Arrangement</b> (2009, Stones Throw Records) [Soul] ★★★☆
  <br>
  Eleven love songs by a proud Detroit native. "I Wish It Would Rain"	is the obvious tribute. The genious and less obvious tribute is "She lives on the other side
  of town / And I know that her father doesn't want me hangin' around", which is a call-and-response with the Shangri-Las, "Whatcha mean when ya say that he
  came from the wrong side of town?".

  <b>How Do You Do</b> (2011, Universal Republic) [Soul] ★★★★☆
  <br>
  Nostalgia is the theme. "Welcome to the motor town." Hip-hop aside, this and <i>The Way I See It</i> are two best tributes to the former glory.
