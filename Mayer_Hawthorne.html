  <h1>Mayer Hawthorne</h1>  
  <b>A Strange Arrangement</b> (2009, Stones Throw Records) [Soul] ★★★☆
  <br>
  Eleven love songs from a proud Detroit native. "I Wish It Would Rain"	is obviously a tribute to the Temptations. My favorite line is "She lives on the other side
  of town / And I know that her father doesn't want me hangin' around", which I think is a less obvious tribute to the Shangri-Las, "Whatcha mean when ya say that he
  came from the wrong side of town?".
