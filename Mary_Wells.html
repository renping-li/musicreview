  <h1>Mary Wells</h1>  
  <b>20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection: Best Of Mary Wells</b> (1999, Motown) [Soul] [Motown] ★★★★★ 
  <br> 
  A perfect compilation album for the brief career of the best female singer of Motown. If I am thrown to an island for the rest of my life and can only bring the records of two Motown artists, it would be Mary Wells and David Ruffin. Sorry, Marvin, you come the third.
